 ## Problem Statement
 
The [World Health Organization (WHO)](https://www.who.int/health-topics/ageing#tab=tab_1) facts say that by 2050, 2 billion people will be 60 or older. Today, people aged 60 outnumber the children under 5. Facts also suggest that by 2050, about 80% of the older people will live in low and middle income countries. All this calls a need for policy-makers to develop policies for active ageing of the population. The World Health Organization released an [active ageing framework](https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/67215/WHO_NMH_NPH_02.8.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y) to acknowledge and support the major role that people play as they age in caring for others. There was a need to implement this framework digitally for the elederly to actively age in times of the Pandemic. 
 
 ## Solution
 
<strong> "Actif ageing" </strong> is a portal based on the WHO framework which utilizes the three key policy proposals of <strong> Health, Participation </strong> and <strong> Security </strong> to promote active ageing. This portal makes a way for physical and mental well being, civic and social participation, safety and security including diversity and inclusion at workplaces. The portal has elderly oriented interface and supports them in any and every way possible in accordance to the WHO framework. The key highlights of this portal include <strong> opportunities for work, awareness and access to health care, assistive devices, care giver support platform, awareness about rights of older persons and vital information to access care and most importantly opportunities to strengthen social network of older persons. </strong>
